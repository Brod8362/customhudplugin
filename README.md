# customhudplugin

Small plugin to make the actionbar useful.

## Building
Because SBT doesn't like the maven repos for spigot, you need to use `BuildTools.jar` and use the local maven repo instead.

`BuildTools.jar` is easy enough to get, from there you just do `java -jar BuildTools.jar --rev 1.19` (replace 1.19 with whatever)

to future me trying to build this: you're welcome!
